This directory contains TWebCanvas class which provides web-based TCanvasImp
and allows display of ROOT TCanvas in the web browser.
BEGIN_HTML
This is fully reimplements TVirtualX and TVirtualPadPainter classes, 
supporting majority of existing ROOT classes. Implementation does not
provide some interactive features - like custom mouse events handling. 
Object changes performed in the browser (histogram color change) 
are not reflected in the C++ objects - WebGui provides READ-ONLY display capability
