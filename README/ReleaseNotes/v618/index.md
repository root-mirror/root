## Deprecation and Removal

### THttpServer classes

The following methods were deprecated and removed:

   * Bool_t THttpServer::SubmitHttp(THttpCallArg *arg, Bool_t can_run_immediately = kFALSE, Bool_t ownership = kFALSE);
   * Bool_t THttpServer::ExecuteHttp(THttpCallArg *arg)
   * Bool_t TRootSniffer::Produce(const char *path, const char *file, const char *options, void *&ptr, Long_t &length, TString &str);
   * TString THttpCallArg::GetPostDataAsString();
   * void THttpCallArg::FillHttpHeader(TString &buf, const char *header = nullptr);
   * void THttpCallArg::SetBinData(void *data, Long_t length);

The methods could be replaced by equivalent methods with other signature:

   * Bool_t THttpServer::SubmitHttp(std::shared_ptr<THttpCallArg> arg, Bool_t can_run_immediately = kFALSE);
   * Bool_t THttpServer::ExecuteHttp(std::shared_ptr<THttpCallArg> arg);
   * Bool_t TRootSniffer::Produce(const std::string &path, const std::string &file, const std::string &options, std::string &res);
   * const void *THttpCallArg::GetPostData() const;
   * Long_t THttpCallArg::GetPostDataLength() const;
   * std::string THttpCallArg::FillHttpHeader(const char *header = nullptr);
   * void THttpCallArg::SetContent(std::string &&cont);


## Core Libraries


## I/O Libraries

### TNetXNGFile
Added necessary changes to allow [XRootD local redirection](https://github.com/xrootd/xrootd/blob/8c9d0a9cc7f00cbb2db35be275c35126f3e091c0/docs/ReleaseNotes.txt#L14)
  - Uses standard VectorReadLimits and does not query a XRootD data server (which is unknown in local redirection), when it is redirected to a local file
  - Adds a new constructor with a const char *lurl to TNetXNGFile and passes it to TFile, if set. This allows redirection to files that have a different name in the local file system and is important to allow derivation (for example to TAlien and TJAlienFile) while still keeping functionality via TArchiveFile when the file name in the local file system does not match `*.zip`

## TTree Libraries

### RDataFrame
  - Use TPRegexp instead of TRegexp to interpret the regex used to select columns
    in the invocation of `Cache` and `Snapshot`. This allows usage of a larger set
    of regular expressions to specify which columns should be written out.
  - Speed up jitting of Filter and Define expressions passed as string
  - Speed up event loop, improve scaling in the presence of a large amount of Defines
  - Allow Filter expressions to return types convertible to bool, rather than only bool
  - Add `GetNSlots` method to easily retrieve the number of slots that will be used by
    `DefineSlot, `ForeachSlot`, `OnPartialResultSlot`, ...
  - Add support for TTrees/TChains with TEntryLists (currently only for single-thread event loops)
  - Add `HasColumn` method to check whether a column is available to a given RDF node
  - PyROOT: add `AsRNode` helper function to convert RDF nodes to the common RNode type
  - PyROOT: add `AsNumpy` method to export contents of a RDataFrame as a dictionary of numpy arrays

### TLeafF16 and TLeafD32
  - New leaf classes allowing to store Float and Double values using the truncation methods from TBuffer
    (See for example `TBuffer::WriteDouble32`)
  - The new types can be specified using the type characters 'f' (Float16_t) and 'd' (Double32_t)
  - It is also possible to specify a range and a number of bits to be stored using the syntax from `TStreamerElement::GetRange`.
    Therefore the range and bits specifier has to be attached to the type character.
  - All functionalities of the other datatypes have been reimplemented.
  - The documentation of `TTree` and `TBuffer` has been updated accordingly.
  - The following exmple shows how to use the new features:
~~~ {.cpp}
      {
         Float16_t  floatVal;
         Float16_t  floatArray[7];
         Double32_t doubleVal;
         Double32_t doubleArray[5];

         TTree *tree = new TTree("tree", "An example tree using the new data types");
         tree->Branch("floatVal",   &floatVal,    "floatVal/f");               // Float16_t value with default settings
         tree->Branch("floatArray",  floatArray,  "floatArray[7]/f[0,100]");   // Float16_t array with range from 0 to 100
         tree->Branch("doubleVal",  &doubleVal,   "doubleVal/d[0,1000,20]");   // Double32_t value with range from 0 to 1000 and 20 bits
         tree->Branch("doubleArray", doubleArray, "doubleArray[5]/d[0,0,18]"); // Double32_t array without range and 18 bits
      }
~~~

## Histogram Libraries


## Math Libraries


## RooFit Libraries
### HistFactory
hist2workspace performance optimisations. For a large, ATLAS-style Higgs-->bb workspace with > 100 systematic uncertainties and more than 10 channels, the run time decreases by a factor 11 to 12.

### Faster, STL-like Collections in RooFit
RooFit's collections `RooArgSet` and `RooArgList` have been made more STL-like. The underlying implementation used to be the `RooLinkedList`, but now both collections work with `std::vector`. The collections have an STL-like interface concerning iterators such that iterations over the two collections that looked like
```
TIterator* depIter = intDepList.createIterator() ;
RooAbsArg* arg;
while((arg=(RooAbsArg*)depIter->Next())) {
  ...
}
delete depIter;
```
now look like:
```
for (auto arg : intDepList) {
  ...
}
```
Depending on how many elements are iterated, RooFit will be between 10 and 20% faster if the new iterators are used. Heavily using old iterators might slow it down by 5 to 10%. Iterators in key classes have been updated, such that many workflows in RooFit are 10 - 20% faster.

#### Legacy iterators
The (three kinds) of legacy iterators in RooFit are still supported, such that old code will not break, but they are slower than `begin(), end()` and range-based for loops.

**Important caveat**:
The old RooFit collections could be modified while iterating. The STL-like iterators do not support this (as for a *e.g.* std::vector)! Using the legacy iterators with the new collections (*i.e.* in existing code), mutating the collection is still possible in the following cases:
- Inserting/deleting elements **after** the current iterator.
- Changing an element at a position **other than** the current iterator
- **But not** inserting/deleting before/at the current iterator position. With a debug build (with assertions), the legacy iterators will check that the collection is not mutated. In a release build, elements might be skipped or be iterated twice.

#### Moving away from the slower iterators
The legacy iterators have been flagged with a special deprecation macro that can be used help the user use the recommended ROOT interface. Defining `R__SUGGEST_NEW_INTERFACE`, (either in a single translation unit or in the build system), all uses of the legacy iterators will trigger a compiler warning like:
```
<path>/RooChebychev.cxx:66:34: warning: 'createIterator' is deprecated: There is a superior alternative: begin(), end() and range-based for loops. [-Wdeprecated-declarations]
  TIterator* coefIter = coefList.createIterator() ;
                                 ^
1 warning generated.
```




## 2D Graphics Libraries

  - In the statistics painting for 2D histograms, the central cell of
    the underflow/overflow grid was not properly rendered for very large contents.
    This problem was reported [here](https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/stat-box-for-th2/).
  - The automatic placement of legend now "sees" TMultiGraph and THStack.
  - Improve and simplify the drawing the 2D histogram's option "ARR".
  - The option ARR can be combined with the option COL or COLZ.
  - `TBox::DistancetoPrimitive` and `TBox::ExecuteEvent` now work in log scales (by Jérémie Dudouet).
  - Take the line attributes into account when drawing a histogram with option bar or hbar.
    They were ignored until now.
  - The new draw option MIN0 makes same effect as gStyle->SetHistMinimumZero(1), but can be specified
    individually for each histogram.
  - Improve the line clipping when a histogram is drawn with option "L". The following
    example shows the improvement.
~~~ {.cpp}
      {
         auto h = new TH1F("h","h",5,0.5,5.5);
         h->SetBinContent(1,100000);
         h->SetBinContent(2,10000);
         h->SetBinContent(3,1000);
         h->SetBinContent(4,100);
         h->SetBinContent(5,10);
         h->SetMinimum(50.);
         h->SetMaximum(40000);
         h->Draw("L*");
         gPad->SetLogy();
      }
~~~

## 3D Graphics Libraries

  - Make sure a TF3 is painted the same way in GL and non-GL mode.
    The mismatch was reported in [this post](https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/how-to-specify-the-level-value-in-isosurface-drawing-with-tf3-and-gl/32179)

### Header location and `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY` / `ROOT_STANDARD_LIBRARY_PACKAGE`

A change in the argument handling of `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY` and `ROOT_STANDARD_LIBRARY_PACKAGE` might need your attention:
these macros now respect whether a header file was passed with its fulla relative path (the common case), or with a full path.
The latter allows to find headers at runtime - at the cost of a loss of relocatability: you cannot move the library containing
that dictionary to a different directory, because the header location is stored in the dictionary. This case is used by roottest
but should likely not be used by anything but test suites.

Instead pass relative paths, together with a `-I` option to find the headers, plus setting `ROOT_INCLUDE_PATH` for finding the
headers back at runtime. The ROOT stress suite is now updated to follow this behavior; see for instance the injection of
`$ROOTSYS/test` in `test/stressMathCore.cxx`, allowing ROOT to find the header at runtime, whether interpreted
(`R__ADD_INCLUDE_PATH`) or compiled (`TROOT::AddExtraInterpreterArgs({"-I..."})` before interpreter construction).

If you called `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY(Dict ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/subdir/Header1.h LINKDEF LinkDef.h)` then update that
call to `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY(Dict Header1.h OPTIONS -I subdir LINKDEF LinkDef.h)` *if* the header is usually included as
`#include "Header1.h"`, or to `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY(Dict subdir/Header1.h LINKDEF LinkDef.h)` *if* the header is usually
included as `#include "subdir/Header1.h"`. I.e. the general rule is: pass to `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY` (or
`ROOT_STANDARD_LIBRARY_PACKAGE`) the spelling as `#include`ed.

As an important side-effect, `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY` and thus `ROOT_STANDARD_LIBRARY_PACKAGE` now *require* the header to
be found at configuration time. We have seen too many cases where the header location was mis-stated, and as a consequence,
CMake did not generate the proper dependencies. If the header should not be taken into account for dependencies and / or if
the header will not be found (e.g. the standard library's `vector`) please pass the header through the `NODEPHEADERS` option
to `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY` or `ROOT_STANDARD_LIBRARY_PACKAGE`.

We believe that this simplification / regularization of behavior, and the additional checks are worth the possible changes
on the user side.
