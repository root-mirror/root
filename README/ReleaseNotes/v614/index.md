## Removed interfaces

## Core Libraries
   - Optimize away redundant deserialization of template specializations. This reduces the memory footprint for hsimple
     by around 22% while improving the runtime performance for various cases by around 15%.
   - When ROOT is signaled with a SIGUSR2 (i.e. on Linux and MacOS X) it will now print a backtrace.

## I/O Libraries
   - Implement reading of objects data from JSON
   - Provide TBufferJSON::ToJSON() and TBufferJSON::FromJSON() methods
   - Provide TBufferXML::ToXML() and TBufferXML::FromXML() methods

## TTree Libraries

### TDataFrame

## Histogram Libraries

## Math Libraries

## RooFit Libraries

## 2D Graphics Libraries
   - `TMultiGraph::GetHistogram` now works even if the multigraph is not drawn. Make sure
     it never returns a null pointer.
   - X11 line `width = 0` doesn't work on OpenSuSE Thumbleweed for non solid lines. Now fixed.
   - TCanvas::SetWindowsSize has been changed to get the same window size in interactive mode…and batch mode.
   - Change the `TGraph` default fill color to white to avoid black box in legend
     when `gPad->BuildLegend()` is called.
   - Auto-coloring for TF1 (drawing options PFC, PLC and PMC) is implemented.
   - Auto-coloring for TH1::DrawCopy (drawing options PFC, PLC and PMC) is implemented.
   - Improve the option management in `TF1::Draw` to allow to combine the option
     `SAME` with other drawing options.
   - `TGraph::Draw("AB")` was malfunctioning when using `TAxis::SetRangeUser`.
      It was reported [here](https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/ROOT-9144).
   - The errors end-caps size in `TLegend` follows the value set by `gStyle->SetEndErrorSize()`.
     For instance setting it to 0 allows to remove the end-caps both on the graph and the legend.
     It was requested [here](https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/ROOT-9184)
   - New color palette "cividis"implemented by Sven Augustin.
     This colormap aims to solve problems that people with color vision deficiency have
     with the common colormaps. For more details see:
     Nuñez J, Anderton C, and Renslow R. Optimizing colormaps with consideration
     for color vision deficiency to enable accurate interpretation of scientific data.
     See the article [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01662)
   - New graphics style "ATLAS" from M.Sutton.
   - In `TGraphPainter` the fit parameters were painted too early. [In some cases graph's
     error bars overlapped the stat box](https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/hide-error-bars-behind-tpavestats/27996).


## 3D Graphics Libraries
  - When a LEGO plot was drawn with Theta=90, the X and Y axis were misplaced.

## Geometry Libraries

## Database Libraries

## Networking Libraries

Changes in websockets handling in THttpServer.
   - New THttpWSHandler class should be used to work with websockets.
     It includes all necessary methods to handle multiple connections correctly.
     See in tutorials/http/ws.C how it can be used.
   - Interface of THttpWSEngine class was changed, all its instances handled internally in THttpWSHandler.

## GUI Libraries

## Montecarlo Libraries

## Parallelism

## Language Bindings

## JavaScript ROOT

## Tutorials

  - New graphics tutorial AtlasExample.C illustrating the ATLAS style

## Class Reference Guide

## Build, Configuration and Testing Infrastructure

The `python3` option to CMake has been removed. Python support is enabled by
default. To configure ROOT to use specific Python versions, there is a new
option called `python_version`. This is how to configure ROOT and Python for
the common use cases:

* Use the default Python interpreter:
  - `-Dpython=ON` (default)
* Search only for Python 2.x or only 3.x:
  - `-Dpython_version=2` or `-Dpython_version=3`
* Use a specific version of Python from `$PATH`:
  - `-Dpython_version=2.7` or `-Dpython_version=3.5`
* Use a specific Python interpreter, whatever the version:
  - `-DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/local/bin/python`

Note: The use of `PYTHON_EXECUTABLE` requires the full path to the interpreter.
