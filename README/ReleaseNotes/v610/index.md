## Removed interfaces

The following interfaces have been removed, after deprecation in v6.08.

### CINT remnants, dysfunctional for ROOT 6
- `TInterpreter`'s `Getgvp()`, `Getp2f2funcname(void*)`, `Setgvp(Long_t)`, `SetRTLD_NOW()`, `SetRTLD_LAZY()`.
- `SetFCN(void*)` from TVirtualFitter, TFitter, TBackCompFitter, TMinuit
- `TFoam::SetRhoInt(void*)`


## Core Libraries

## Histogram Libraries

- New class `THnChain` was added to provide a `TChain`-like experience when
  working with `THnBase`'ed histograms (currently `THn` and `THnSparse`) from
  many files, see [here](https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/ROOT-4515). This
  allows to e.g., interactively adjust axis parameters before performing
  projections from high-dimensional histograms,

  ```{.cpp}
  // Create a chain of histograms called `h`.
  THnChain chain("h");

  // Add files containing histograms `h` to `chain`.
  chain->AddFile("file1.root");

  chain->GetXaxis(1)->SetRangeUser(0.1, 0.2);

  TH1* projection = chain->Projection(0)
  ```


## Math Libraries


## RooFit Libraries


## TTree Libraries


## 2D Graphics Libraries
- If one used "col2" or "colz2", the value of `TH1::fMaximum` got modified.
  This deviated from the behavior of "col" or "colz". This is now fixed as
  requested [here](https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/ROOT-8389).
- When the option SAME (or "SAMES") is used with the option COL, the boxes' color
  are computing taking the previous plots into account. The range along the Z axis
  is imposed by the first plot (the one without option SAME); therefore the order
  in which the plots are done is relevant.
- With option BOX on 2D histos with negative content:
    - do not draw the empty bins as requested [here](https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/ROOT-8385).
    - fix the issue mentioned [here](https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/ROOT-*402).
- When several histogram were drawn on top of each other with the option
  `BOX SAME` and if the log scale along Z was on, the plot showed only the
  first histogram. This can be reproduce by using the documentation example
  illustrating `BOX SAME`and turning the canvas into log scale along Z.
- In TLatex: Do not paint the text when the text size is <= 0. This fixes
  the problem mentioned [here](https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/ROOT-8305)
- From: Sergey Linev: In `TPad::SaveAs` method json file extension is now handled
- Because of some precision issue some data points exactly on the plot limits of
  a `TGraph2D` were not drawn (option `P`).
  The problem was reported [here](https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/ROOT-8447).
- New options for automatic coloring of graphs and histograms. When several
  histograms or graphs are painted in the same canvas thanks to the option "SAME"
  via a `THStack` or `TMultigraph` it might be useful to have an easy and automatic
  way to choose their color. The simplest way is to pick colors in the current active color
  palette. Palette coloring for histogram is activated thanks to the options `PFC`
  (Palette Fill Color), `PLC` (Palette Line Color) and `AMC` (Palette Marker Color).
  When one of these options is given to `TH1::Draw` the histogram get its color
  from the current color palette defined by `gStyle->SetPalette(â€¦)`. The color
  is determined according to the number of objects having palette coloring in
  the current pad.
- The line width and line style can be change on 2d histograms painted with
  option `ARR`.
- When the angle of a TGraphPolar was not in radian, the error bars were misplaced.
  The problem was reported [here](https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/ROOT-8476).
- In `TASimage::DrawLineInternal` the case of a line with 0 pixel along X and 0
  pixel along Y was not treated properly. An horizontal line was drawn instead.
- In `TGraphPainter::PaintGrapHist`: Decouple the `P` option (histogram drawn with
  a simple polymarker) from the `L`(Histogram drawn as a simple polyline). This
  improved (in some cases some extra markers were drawn) and simplify. the code.
- Candle plot improvements:
   * Rearragement of TCandle-code - split into calculate and paint
   * Implementation for a "raw-data candle" inside TCandle - to be used from TTreeViewer in the future
   * Implementation of 1D histograms along each candle (left, right and violin) - to be used for violin-charts
   * Implementation of a zero indicator line for TCandle - to be used for violin-charts
   * Reimplementation if THistPainter draw option VIOLIN
   * Implementations of presets and individual options for VIOLIN-charts
   * Implementation of VIOLIN-charts in THStack - can be combined with CANDLE
   * Update of the docs (THistPainter and THStack)
   * New tutorials

## 3D Graphics Libraries
- In `TMarker3DBox::PaintH3` the boxes' sizes was not correct.
- The option `BOX`and `GLBOX` now draw boxes with a volume proportional to the
  bin content to be conform to the 2D case where the surface of the boxes is
  proportional to the bin content.

## Geometry Libraries


## I/O Libraries
- [[https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/ROOT-8478](https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/ROOT-8478)] - Prompt error when building streamer info and a data member is a vector<T> w/o dictionary

## Build, Configuration and Testing Infrastructure
- Added the CMake exported ROOT libraries into the ROOT:: namespace. In this way, projects based on CMake using ROOT can avoid
  conflicts in library target names. As an example, this is the way to build a project consisting of one library and one
  executable using ROOT.
  ```
  find_package(ROOT REQUIRED)
  include(${ROOT_USE_FILE})

  include_directories(${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR} ${ROOT_INCLUDE_DIRS})
  add_definitions(${ROOT_CXX_FLAGS})

  ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY(G__Event Event.h LINKDEF EventLinkDef.h)

  add_library(Event SHARED Event.cxx G__Event.cxx)
  target_link_libraries(Event ROOT::Hist ROOT::Tree)

  add_executable(Main MainEvent.cxx)
  target_link_libraries(Main Event)
  ```
- Added option `builtin_all` to enable all the built in options.
