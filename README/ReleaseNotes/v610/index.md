## Removed interfaces

The following interfaces have been removed, after deprecation in v6.08.

### CINT remnants, dysfunctional for ROOT 6
- `TInterpreter`'s `Getgvp()`, `Getp2f2funcname(void*)`, `Setgvp(Long_t)`, `SetRTLD_NOW()`, `SetRTLD_LAZY()`.
- `SetFCN(void*)` from TVirtualFitter, TFitter, TBackCompFitter, TMinuit
- `TFoam::SetRhoInt(void*)`


## Core Libraries

## Histogram Libraries


## Math Libraries


## RooFit Libraries


## TTree Libraries


## 2D Graphics Libraries
- If one used "col2" or "colz2", the value of `TH1::fMaximum` got modified.
  This deviated from the behavior of "col" or "colz". This is now fixed as
  requested [here](https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/ROOT-8389).
- When the option SAME (or "SAMES") is used with the option COL, the boxes' color
  are computing taking the previous plots into account. The range along the Z axis
  is imposed by the first plot (the one without option SAME); therefore the order
  in which the plots are done is relevant.
- With option BOX on 2D histos with negative content:
    - do not draw the empty bins as requested [here](https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/ROOT-8385).
    - fix the issue mentioned [here](https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/ROOT-*402).
- When several histogram were drawn on top of each other with the option
  `BOX SAME` and if the log scale along Z was on, the plot showed only the
  first histogram. This can be reproduce by using the documentation example
  illustrating `BOX SAME`and turning the canvas into log scale along Z.
- In TLatex: Do not paint the text when the text size is <= 0. This fixes
  the problem mentioned [here](https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/ROOT-8305)
- From: Sergey Linev: In `TPad::SaveAs` method json file extension is now handled
- Because of some precision issue some data points exactly on the plot limits of
  a `TGraph2D` were not drawn (option `P`).
  The problem was reported [here](https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/ROOT-8447).
- New options for automatic coloring of graphs and histograms. When several
  histograms or graphs are painted in the same canvas thanks to the option "SAME"
  via a `THStack` or `TMultigraph` it might be useful to have an easy and automatic
  way to choose their color. The simplest way is to pick colors in the current active color
  palette. Palette coloring for histogram is activated thanks to the options `PFC`
  (Palette Fill Color), `PLC` (Palette Line Color) and `AMC` (Palette Marker Color).
  When one of these options is given to `TH1::Draw` the histogram get its color
  from the current color palette defined by `gStyle->SetPalette(â€¦)`. The color
  is determined according to the number of objects having palette coloring in
  the current pad.

## 3D Graphics Libraries
- In `TMarker3DBox::PaintH3` the boxes' sizes was not correct.
- The option `BOX`and `GLBOX` now draw boxes with a volume proportional to the
  bin content to be conform to the 2D case where the surface of the boxes is
  proportional to the bin content.
