\class ROOT::Experimental::TDF::TDataSource
\ingroup dataframe
\brief The TDataSource interface dictates how a TDataFrame interface to an arbitrary data format should look like.

A TDataSource allows to seamlessly provide an adaptor for any kind of data set
or data format to the TDataFrame. Another way to imagine it is a veritable
"cursor".
The data sources are not supposed to be used as they are from the user but
rather as a way to plug a dataset into a TDataFrame.
